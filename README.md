#Tests
To run tests, you have to configure the test environment :
in .dev.test, update the `DATABASE_URL` with your database information and the `BASE_URI` with your base uri.

Now you can run tests with the following commands :
- `vendor/bin/behat` : run all tests
- `vendor/bin/behat --tags '@tag_name'` : run specific scenarios
- `vendor/bin/behat --name 'element of feature'` : Only execute the feature elements which match part of the given name or regex.

The test files are located in /features/features/api/
